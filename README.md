# oop-proj
OOP project gang 100% world's hardest game ;)


okay so the way this whole thing works:

OHG.cpp (OOP's Hardest Game) is the main file from which the game is created
the Game Class deals with running the Game and doing all Game things, like making windows, players etc
GameEntity class is (will be) an abstract class for Game Entities like player, walls, enemies etc
Player does player things, same goes for Enemies, Walls and, coming soon, Collectibles
game1.cpp was a drafting / testing game from which we based some basics
